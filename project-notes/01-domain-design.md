## üß± Subdomain Classification

According to DDD, the domain is divided into three categories: **Core**, **Supporting**, and **Generic**.

| Category   | Subdomain           | Description                                               |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

|            | Product Search      | Finding the desired product is at the core of the business |
|            | Refund Management   | Handling and tracking refund processes (bounded context)   |

|            | File Storage        | File management and storage                                 |
|            | Monitoring          | Prometheus, Grafana, etc.                                   |
|            | API Gateway         | Routing, security, rate limiting                            |
|            | Service Discovery   | Technical routing service                                   |
