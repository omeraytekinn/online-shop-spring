# Modular Project Structure with Hexagonal Architecture

This document explains the reasoning behind our modular project setup and how it aligns with Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

---

## üß± Goals

- Clean architectural separation: domain logic decoupled from frameworks
- Modular structure: each service is built as independent units (domain, application, infrastructure)
- Port & Adapter (Hexagonal) architecture for flexibility and testability
- Spring Boot only at infrastructure level
- Maven multi-module for shared versioning and reusable libraries

## üîó Dependency Flow

We follow the **clean dependency rule**:

```

domain -> application -> infrastructure

````

- Domain: no dependencies, pure Java
- Application: depends on domain
- Infrastructure: depends on domain, application and framework & libraries
- All dependency injection and framework wiring happens in the infrastructure layer.

---

## üöÄ Maven Setup

Each `product-service` (or other service) is a multi-module Maven project:

- `product-service/pom.xml`: defines modules (domain, application, infra)
- `domain` & `application`: `packaging = jar`
- `infrastructure`: `packaging = jar` with Spring Boot dependencies

The root `pom.xml` registers all services as modules and manages shared dependency versions.

```xml
<modules>
  <module>services/product-service</module>
</modules>
````

Each module inherits from this root unless it has its own.

## ‚ùì Why Hexagonal Architecture?

* Keep domain logic independent of frameworks
* Make core business testable without Spring
* Delay technical decisions (e.g., database, messaging tech)
* Cleanly separate responsibilities

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Framework-free domain and use case code
* Easily testable core
* Isolated responsibilities
* Reusable base for other services (with common-lib in future)
* More readable and professional-looking architecture
